      <p>In this exciting game, your goal is to collect various fruits in order to earn points. You will spawn in the center of the game map, and from there you are free to travel to any of the three islands in any order you choose. To move around the game map, please use the arrow keys on your keyboard. When you see the fruits on an island, you can aim at them using the raycasters. Once you are aimed correctly, simply click to collect the fruits. To win the game, make sure you collect all the fruits from all three different islands. If you do this, you are the winner! Happy collecting!

        <li>Stage 1: Watermelon World (easy)
          In Watermelon World, your job is to click on the watermelons. They will move across the screen, and you need to collect them. If you collect all the watermelons, you can go to the next stage. It’s super easy to start with!

        </li>
        <li>Stage 2: Apple Amazon (medium)
        Next, we have Apple Amazon. Here, apples will fall from the sky. You need to click on them before they hit the ground. Even if an apple touches the ground, you can still grab it! Try to collect as many apples as you can. It’s a little more challenging than the first stage.
</li>
        <li>Stage 4: Blueberry Boss (hard)
          Finally, we reach the Blueberry Boss level. This is the hardest one! You need to collect ten blueberries before they touch the ground. You have to start over if you can't collect 10 blueberry before they dissapear. It’s tough, but don’t give up!
